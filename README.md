# colorsWithGradience

#### This is a page where you see magic by tapping the button on the webpage and watch colors changing with slight gradience. Everytime you give a tap, a new set of hex gradient colors get generated randomly. Go ahead try it.

* On the right side you will see a link to the published github page.
* Click that link and check for yourself :)
